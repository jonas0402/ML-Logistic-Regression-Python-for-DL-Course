# ML-Logistic-Regression-Python-for-DL-Course
This is a project done through the Udemy course. I worked using the sklearn module to apply logistic regression model to an advertising dataset. Logistic regression fits well as a classification method. I also import the metric function from sklearn to see the report that shows the accuracy of the model.
